The other options like "likely," "similarly," and "same" do not fit grammatically or contextually in this sentence. "Likely" suggests probability, "similarly" is not correctly positioned as it requires a comparison, and "same" is awkward and does not convey the intended meaning effectively.

Select the most appropriate synonym of the given word.<br>COERCE	cajole	leave	enchant	pressurize	4	"Pressurize" is the most appropriate synonym for "coerce" as both involve forcing someone to act in a certain way, often against their will. "Cajole" means to persuade through flattery or deceit, which differs from the forceful connotation of "coerce." "Leave" does not relate to coercion, and "enchant" implies attraction rather than force.	ENG Prelims-1 Synonym
Select the most appropriate meaning of the given idiom.<br>At daggers drawn	bitterly hostile	without hope	deceiving somebody	friendly with each other	1	The idiom "at daggers drawn" means to be in a state of bitter hostility or deep conflict with someone. This is because "daggers" symbolize aggression and hostility. The other options are incorrect as they do not capture the meaning of intense animosity: "without hope" implies despair, "deceiving somebody" suggests trickery, and "friendly with each other" directly contradicts the notion of being hostile.

If no substitution is required, select No improvement.&nbsp;<br>If you park your car here, the trafﬁc police&nbsp;<u>has ﬁned you</u>.	will ﬁne you	ﬁned you	No improvement	have ﬁned you	1	The correct option is "will fine you" because it indicates a future action that will occur if the condition (parking the car) is met. The other options are incorrect: "fined you" implies it has already happened, "No improvement" suggests the original phrase is correct, which it is not, and "have fined you" incorrectly suggests a present perfect tense that doesn't align with the conditional statement.

The other options do not capture the essence of recklessness: being friendly (Option 1) implies amiability; acting cleverly (Option 2) suggests intelligence; and changing places (Option 4) does not relate to the meaning at all.

Medicines need not be bought without the doctor's prescription	Medicines could not be bought without the doctor's prescription	Medicines should not be bought without the doctor's prescription	Medicines might not be bought without the doctor's prescription	3	Option 3 is correct because it accurately reflects the prohibition implied in the original sentence using "should not."

"Given below are four jumbled sentences. Select the option that gives their correct order.<br><ol type=""A""><li>The cafe's owner says he's interested in conservation, and hopes customers will realise the animals are worth saving, even though they often have a bad reputation.</li><li>None of them are venomous, meaning customers can get up close and personal with the reptiles.</li><li>Here you sip your drink in the company of 35 snakes.</li><li>This cafe, which has just opened up in Tokyo, is not for the faint of heart.</li></ol>"	ABCD	DBCA	DCBA	ABDC	3	The correct order is DCBA because sentence 3 introduces the cafe setting, followed by sentence 1, which provides the owner's intentions about conservation. Sentence 2 explains safety regarding the snakes, and sentence 4 emphasizes the cafe’s challenge for visitors. Options 1, 2, and 4 incorrectly sequence the sentences, disrupting the logical flow of introducing the cafe, discussing its purpose, ensuring safety, and then considering the visitor experience.
